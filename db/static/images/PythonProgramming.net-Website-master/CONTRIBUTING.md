#Contributing Guidlines

This project is open source, and it is my hope that people will contribute to help make it into something great.

For specific issues of direct interest, see the issues tab.

#Here are some examples of contributions:

-Contribute to this github. I am still a github noob, not really knowing what I am doing. Help improve the readme, contributing ... etc

-General functionality concepts (handling users, CMS, improving the "one big file" init.py aspect)

-Code fixes and new implementations (some specifics are listed here in the "issues" tab, but feel free to think for yourself)

-Written tutorial updates or improvements (This is primarily an open source code project, though a big part of this website is the delivery of tutorials. If you think you have a better idea, let's see it!)

-Typo fixes in the tutorials can come here as well. I didn't spell check anything in the initial commit, so I am sure I made plenty of mistakes!

The main concern is the UI/UX. If you wish to fix the actual source code itself from the tutorials (for example, updating the code from the MPI tutorials)
, then you are better off editing the source in that respective repository (This is the website code repo, but there are other repos which contain the actual source code from each individual tutorial as well). 

#Regarding UI/UX, I am very interested in:

-Dashboard improvements (Suggestions: Better organization, saving tab location: this way someone can link specifically to the machine learning tab, rather than forcing the user to click through), tutorial suggestions.

-Search: I have been thinking of simply using and re-skinning google search for the easiest, but a nice search in some form would be great. 

-General Navigation

This is a web app, and it's all about the user's experience. We want to make navigating, finding topics of interest, and consuming those topics as pleasurable as possible. 

All changes must come with complete explanations to the reason and purpose for the change.
